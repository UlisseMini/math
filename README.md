## taylor

Experimentation with taylor series, notes:

- I approximate the derivative because I can't be bothered to differentiate a function every time I change it
	- `dx` is large because it was failing when too small, I assume this was due to running out of float precision as the terms it would spit out would be hugely positive or negative. it could also be that a larger `dx` gives more information about the function, making it easier to approximate. I find this unlikely though, because desmos (which I believe does full differentiation) did not have this problem.
